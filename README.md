# Domain Code Kit for TypeScript

With this incredible domain-driven design toolkit, you can easily start coding in TypeScript using these principles. I recommend to read further literature [Khalil Stemmler: Domain Driven Design](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/categories/domain-driven-design) and my [Medium bookmarks](https://medium.com/@AndiReuter/list/domain-driven-design-b4ec21b36221).

# Welcome

Hello ðŸ‘‹,

I actively maintain this toolkit. :rocket:

I like to share my well developed domain driven design toolkit with you. You can use it to kick-off your development and continuously improve your code structure.

You can contact me at any time andireuter86@gmail.com.

# A short word about OSS

I love to share my code with other developers. I look forward to feedback. It gives me the opportunity to learn more and discuss other approaches.
